# PRESENTATION_massControlTool_v2.1

The first program had similar functionality (at the initial stage), but it worked very poorly and did not have GUI
The program is intended for mass control of mediaplayers based on the Raspberry Pi (Internet presence check, availability check using a username and password, file transfer and sending commands)

For connections using SSH. I think, it can work with all linux machines.
The first program was intended primarily for me to understand the principle of interaction between Python and the media player via SSH. Version 2 is already intended for practical use.

All the same, this was the very beginning of my learning the language, I didn’t read any textbooks at that time and just tried to make it work. I didn’t know a lot, including how to split a program into several files, which resulted in about one and a half thousand lines in a single file, and I believe that if we look at the whole code, and not separately by function, it will be very difficult to read it

For GUI used module tkinter, all code fully writed by myself
